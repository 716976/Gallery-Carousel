            <p> <span>Puerto Azul</span><br> A famous beach resort near on ternate. I'm not sure why it became famous, but I'm guessing it's because of the vibe, which many tourists take to keep as souvenirs. This is the first stop over before going through the tunnel. There are a lot of climb spots here, and you will see monkeys everywhere. I wish I could go back someday.</p>
